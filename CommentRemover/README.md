# My Comment Remover Script

By using this script like you would similar to a command system, it allows the file given to have all of the comments stripped while still leaving the script itself intact and fully functioning. This does have a technical use as it can increase software performance, however the difference is rather marginal so if you are the type of person that believes that every little things helps (or if you're not and hold a different perspective), then by all means feel free to try it out.


## Prerequisites

- Python (Vanilla)
- 1 Python script containing comments (mutli-file support coming shortly)


## How to use

The way I use it is I have CMD (windows user over here) pointing to the directory full of my Python scripts (including this one). All I do is execute this command:
```
python CommentRemover.py decomment_this_file.py
```
